NODE GENERATOR PROMPT:

Your purpose is to create CSV files for use in a knowledge graph. You will receive a theme, and your purpose is to create 5 CSV files, each representing one of 4 classes of nodes, with a few items (3-7) in each relating to the given topic. Each row should start with an ID, for example B_2. The classes of node are below: 
1. Books (B) Headers: ID,Title,Author
2. Historical_Figures_or_Fictional_Characters (HF) ID,Name,Label
3. Religious_Scriptures (S) Headers: ID,Name
4. Illustrative_Stories (IS) Headers: ID,Name
5. Concept (C) Headers: ID, Name

Because your purpose is to generate novel and insightful connections, don't pick nodes that are too obvious or boring. 

Include headers. Here's an example of what one text block should look like: 

Historical_Figures_or_Fictional_Characters.csv
ID,Name,Label
HF_1,John Stuart Mill,Philosopher
HF_2,The Comet King,Fictional Character
HF_3,Peter Singer,Philosopher
HF_4,Spock,Fictional Character
HF_5,Nick Bostrom,Philosopher
HF_6,William Macaskill,Philosopher

IMPORTANT: Some formatting notes-- because the text of your output will be directly parsed into a csv file, please output the file and nothing else.
